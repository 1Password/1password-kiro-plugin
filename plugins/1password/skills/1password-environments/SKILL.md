description: Use the local 1Password MCP server to work with secure project environment configuration, 1Password Developer Environments, environment variables, API keys, secrets, and local .env mounts. Use when the user asks to set up env vars for a repo, configure secrets, mount or create a local .env from 1Password, store API keys in 1Password, inspect 1Password Environment variable names, or work with the 1Password MCP server.

# 1Password Environments

Use the 1Password MCP server for all 1Password Developer Environment work.

## Use When

- The user mentions 1Password Environments, 1Password Developer Environments, the 1Password MCP server, or local `.env` files from 1Password.
- The user asks to set up, mount, create, or sync a project `.env` file from a secret manager and 1Password is available.
- The user asks to configure repo environment variables, API keys, tokens, credentials, or secrets securely with 1Password.
- The user wants to list or compare Environment variable names without exposing secret values.

Do not use this skill for unrelated password-manager tasks, arbitrary local `.env` file parsing, or non-1Password secret stores unless the user asks to migrate that configuration into 1Password.

## MCP Contents

The local server exposes these tools:

- `authenticate`
- `list_environments`
- `create_environment`
- `rename_environment`
- `list_variables`
- `append_variables`
- `create_local_env_file`
- `list_local_env_files`

The local server also exposes documentation resources:

- `1password://docs/getting-started`
- `1password://docs/environments-guide`

No resource templates are currently exposed.

## Workflow

1. Call `authenticate` first when you do not already have an account ID for this turn. The 1Password desktop app will ask the user to approve the connection.
2. Use `accountId` for subsequent calls. Server docs may spell the returned value as `account_id`; MCP tool calls use camelCase parameters such as `accountId` and `environmentId`.
3. Call `list_environments` with the returned `accountId` before operating on an Environment, unless the user already provided a current `environmentId`.
4. If the target Environment is ambiguous, ask the user which Environment to use instead of guessing.
5. Use the `environmentId` returned by the server for environment-level calls.
6. Prefer `list_variables` when the user wants to inspect an Environment. It returns names only, not secret values.
7. Use `append_variables` only when the user explicitly asks to add or update variables.
8. Use `create_local_env_file` for local `.env` mounts on macOS or Linux, and pass the absolute `mountPath` the user wants.
9. Use `list_local_env_files` to check existing local mounts before creating a duplicate.

## Common Flows

### Mount 1Password as this repo's `.env`

1. Call `authenticate`.
2. Call `list_environments`.
3. Ask the user to choose an Environment if the request does not identify one clearly.
4. Call `list_local_env_files` for the selected Environment to avoid duplicate mounts.
5. If the user says "here", "this repo", or "this project", use the current workspace's absolute `.env` path as `mountPath`.
6. Call `create_local_env_file` with `accountId`, `environmentId`, `environmentName`, and the absolute `mountPath`.
7. Report the mount path and Environment name, but do not read the mounted `.env` file to verify it.

### Inspect variables

1. Call `authenticate`.
2. Call `list_environments` unless the user already gave an `environmentId`.
3. Use the `environmentId` returned by the server for environment-level calls.
4. Call `list_variables` and summarize variable names only.

### Add or update variables

1. Confirm the user explicitly wants to create or update variables, and collect any missing names or values.
2. Call `authenticate` and resolve the target Environment.
3. Prefer calling `list_variables` first so you can tell whether the requested variable names already exist.
4. Call `append_variables` using the active MCP tool schema exactly as exposed in the current session.
5. When the active schema accepts structured variable objects, use `{ "name": "API_KEY", "value": "...", "concealed": true }` for secrets and `concealed: false` only for non-sensitive values such as URLs or feature flags.
6. When the active schema exposes `variables` as `string[]`, do not send unsupported object fields. Use the string format required by that schema, and ask for clarification if the user's requested variable format is ambiguous.

## Tools

- `authenticate`: authenticate with the 1Password desktop app and return the account ID.
- `list_environments`: list Developer Environments for an account.
- `create_environment`: create a new Developer Environment.
- `rename_environment`: rename an existing Developer Environment.
- `list_variables`: list variable names in an Environment without returning values.
- `append_variables`: add or update Environment variables.
- `create_local_env_file`: mount an Environment as a local `.env` file on macOS or Linux.
- `list_local_env_files`: list local `.env` mounts for an Environment.

## Error Handling

- If authentication or environment access fails, tell the user the 1Password desktop app may need approval, unlocking, or account access.
- If the MCP server is unavailable, tell the user to enable the 1Password Labs MCP Server experiment in the desktop app. The server docs mention the Labs deep link `onepassword://settings/labs`.
- If the Labs setting is missing, the account may not have the required `ai-local-mcp-server` feature flag.
- Local `.env` mounts are documented for macOS and Linux only.

## Safety

- Do not reveal, log, or echo secret values.
- Do not read a mounted `.env` file just to verify it exists; use the MCP tools instead.
- Ask before creating or modifying Environment variables unless the user's request is already explicit.
- Treat local `.env` mounts as sensitive even though 1Password does not persist plaintext secret contents to disk.
- If a user pasted a secret into the chat, avoid repeating it back; refer to it by variable name.

## Notes

The local MCP server is enabled from 1Password Labs in the desktop app and connects through the bundled `onepassword-mcp` binary. Local `.env` mounts are supported on macOS and Linux.
